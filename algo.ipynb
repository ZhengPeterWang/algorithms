    "\n",
    "This is a study note for CS 4820: algorithms. It is meant to be a summary of crucial materials in the course. This was the first time that I wrote notes like this in English.\n",

    "### 1.1 Problem: Interval Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "There are n requests that occupy time intervals. Each of them starts at s(i) and ends at f(i). Only one request could be processed at a time. Find the maximum amount of requests that could be scheduled without time intervals overlapping with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Design\n",
    "\n",
    "While scheduling, always choose the first compatible interval with the least f(i)'s.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: By \"Stays Ahead\" Method. We prove that among all possible solutions, our solution has the least f(i) for every i. Then we prove by contradiction that our solution is optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run Time: O(n log n), from sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Problem: Minimize Lateness Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "All intervals are available from point s. Each has length t(i) and deadline d(i). Scheduling intervals after the deadline will have a lateness penality proportional to lateness time. Only one interval can be processed at a time. All intervals should be scheduled. Find a scheduling of these intervals such that the total lateness is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Always schedule the one with the earliest deadline first.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: By \"Exchange\" Method. First we prove that there is an optimal solution O with no idle time. Then we prove that invert the scheduling of all intervals with deadlines against the \"fully sorted order\" will not increase total lateness. Since intervals can be inverted up untill become fully sorted by their deadlines, our solution is proved to be at least as good as optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Problem: Graph Shortest Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In a graph where each edge is weighed by l(e) non negative, find a path from s to v with the lowest sum of l(e)'s.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Design: Dijkstra's Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from s. Add all nodes already explored to a set S. For each node j with at least an edge connecting to S, refresh its distance to s using\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "d'(v) = min_{e=(u,v):u\\in S}d(u)+l_{e}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: By \"Stay Ahead\" Method. We prove that if another path P' with the shortest distance to v exists, then its cost is no less than the cost of P by the non-negativity of the edge weights and the process of always finding the least cost outward edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run Time: Using a priority queue, Dijkstra costs O(m) + n O(log n) + m O(log n) for a graph with n nodes and m edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Problem: Minimum Spanning Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "A **minimum spanning tree** is a subgraph of a connected and edge-weighted graph that has the least total cost possible. Find the minimum spanning tree of a connected edge-weighed graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Design\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kruskal's Algorithm**: Start from no edges at all, and insert edges by increasing cost. We only insert those which do not create cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prim's Algorithm**: Start from any node s, build up set S by adding node v that minimizes the attachment cost $min_{e=(u,v): u \\in S} C_e$ to S. The edges added form a minimum spanning tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reverse-Delete Algorithm**: Start from the full graph, delete edges by decreasing cost. Only delete those that will not make the graph disconnected.\n",
